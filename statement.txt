Farmer John has a binary string of length \( \mathrm{N}\left(1 \leq \mathrm{N} \leq 10^{9}\right) \), initially all zeros.
He will first perform \( \mathrm{M}\left(1 \leq \mathrm{M} \leq 2 \cdot 10^{5}\right) \) updates on the string, in order. Each update flips every character from 1 to r. Specifically, flipping a character changes it from 0 to 1 , or vice versa.

Then, he asks you \( \mathrm{Q}\left(1 \leq \mathrm{Q} \leq 2 \cdot 10^{5}\right) \) queries. For each query, he asks you to output the lexicographically greatest subsequence of length k comprised of characters from the substring from 1 to r . If your answer is a binary string \( \mathrm{s}_{1} \mathrm{~s}_{2} \ldots \mathrm{~s}_{\mathrm{k}} \), then output \( \sum_{\mathrm{i}=0}^{\mathrm{k}-1} 2^{\mathrm{i}} \cdot \mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{k}-\mathrm{i}} \) (that is, its value when interpreted as a binary number) modulo \( 10^{9}+7 \).

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Recall that string A is lexicographically greater than string B of equal length if and only if at the first position i , if it exists, where \( A_{i} \neq B_{i} \), we have \( A_{i} > B_{i} \).

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
The first line contains \( \mathrm{N}, \mathrm{M} \), and Q .
The next M lines contain two integers, 1 and \( \mathrm{r}(1 \leq 1 \leq \mathrm{r} \leq \mathrm{N}) \) - the endpoints of each update.
The next Q lines contain three integers, \( 1, \mathrm{r} \), and \( \mathrm{k}(1 \leq 1 \leq \mathrm{r} \leq \mathrm{N}, 1 \leq \mathrm{k} \leq \mathrm{r}-1+1)- \) the endpoints of each query and the length of the subsequence.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
Output Q lines. The ith line should contain the answer for the ith query.

After performing the M operations, the string is 10101 .
For the first query, there is only one subsequence of length 5,10101 , which is interpreted as \( 1 \cdot 2^{4}+0 \cdot 2^{3}+1 \cdot 2^{2}+0 \cdot 2^{1}+1 \cdot 2^{0}=21 \).

For the second query, there are 5 unique subsequences of length \( 4: 0101,1101,1001,1011,1010 \). The lexicographically largest subsequence is 1101 , which is interpreted as \( 1 \cdot 2^{3}+1 \cdot 2^{2}+0 \cdot 2^{1}+1 \cdot 2^{0}=13 \).

For the third query, the lexicographically largest sequence is 111 , which is interpreted as 7.

Make sure to output the answer modulo 10^9+7.
